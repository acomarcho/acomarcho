# Welcome to My Profile!
My name's Marchotridyo. I'm an undergraduate student currently enrolling informatics in Bandung Institute of Technology, a university located in Bandung, Indonesia.

I'm passionate to learn new stuffs and also teach others. I have been teaching high-school and basic undergraduate mathematics and physics for a long time. In the programming world, I have quite a bit of interest in web development and in competitive programming. Lately, I've been tinkering with design too, especially with Figma and Illustrator.
